# üß† Clustering Notebooks: Educational Exploration of Image and General Clustering

## Overview

This repository contains a set of educational notebooks focused on **clustering techniques** for image analysis and general data exploration. The materials are designed to help you understand and experiment with clustering workflows, with an emphasis on **conceptual clarity**, **practical implementation**, and **visual insight** rather than production-ready solutions.

## üì∏ Notebook 1: Clustering for In-Image Content

**Goal:** Learn how to use clustering to discover regions in images‚Äîsuch as objects, parts, or textures‚Äîwithout labels.

### Topics Covered:

* **Unsupervised Region Discovery** using clustering on pixel or patch features.
* **Spatial and Semantic Coherence**: Enforcing contiguity and using richer feature embeddings (e.g., RGB, Lab+XY, DINO, CLIP).
* **Superpixels & Hierarchies**: From low-level oversegmentation to whole-object discovery.
* **Integration with Foundation Models**:

  * Use CLIP for zero-shot labeling of clusters.
  * Combine with SAM for mask-based proposals.

### Learning Outcomes:

* Understand how spatial priors and feature choices affect cluster quality in images.
* Implement clustering pipelines that go from raw pixels to deep-feature-based segmentation.
* Experiment with combining classical and modern techniques for region-level understanding.

## üìä Notebook 2: Clustering Analysis ‚Äì Methods & Performance

**Goal:** Compare classical and modern clustering algorithms across feature types and dimensionalities.

### Topics Covered:

* **Clustering Methods**:

  * Partitioning: KMeans, KMeans++
  * Hierarchical: HAC, Ward, FINCH
  * Density-based: DBSCAN, OPTICS, HDBSCAN
  * Graph-based: Spectral Clustering
  * Others: BIRCH
* **Feature Representations**: Learn how input features affect clustering results.
* **Performance Metrics**:

  * Quantitative: Runtime, memory usage, silhouette score, adjusted Rand index.
  * Qualitative: Visualizations via PCA/UMAP for interpretability.
* **Dimensionality Comparisons**: High- vs. low-dimensional clustering outcomes.

### Learning Outcomes:

* Build intuition for which clustering algorithms suit your data.
* Benchmark methods based on speed, memory, and clustering fidelity.
* Visualize and interpret cluster structure with dimensionality reduction.
